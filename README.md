Hello my name is Kennedy Shuler. I like playing video games. I swim competitively, and I swim the 100 breaststroke and the 500 freestyle most of the time. My favorite genres are first and third person shooters and action-adventure games. Some of my favorites are the Batman: Arkham series, God of War, Rainbow Six Siege, and Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2. I have two siblings and a dog. I currently work at Shelton Fireworks and it has been going great.
